# Intelligent-Software-Agents
Practice Module 3 for National University of Singapore (ISS) Masters of Technology in Artificial Intelligence
<br>(10 man-days project)

For this Semester, module is on Intelligent Software Agents (Intelligent Process Automation). This space will be updated soon.
quite likely I'll instruction finetune phi-2, align it and red team it for safety and ethics, and use this model in replacing (automating) manual steps in a business process and also intelligently with Human-in-the-loop.

Probably using phi-2 instead of a larger LLM to save on compute time and cost. (AWS isn't cheap, especially when using own funds :) )

However, it also depends on the performance I can get out of phi-2 for simple general conversation, intent classification, NER. On the bright side, if phi-2 is sufficient, it's small enough to deploy in a edge device like a smart phone or table, assuming the inference isn't too slow. We'll see.
