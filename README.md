# Intelligent-Software-Agents
Practice Module 3 for National University of Singapore (ISS) Masters of Technology in Artificial Intelligence
<br>(10 man-days project) - WIP

This Semester's module is on Intelligent Software Agents (Intelligent Process Automation); removing manual toil in business processes with intelligent chatbot agent and Human-in-the-loop.  <br> <br>

**Background**

Recording tasks and sending notifications is a toil for busy professionals in the office, and especially for those on the move. 

For example, 
* A manager or a salesperson driving in a car while conversing on the phone and needing to create a task/appointment without operating a laptop or mobile phone while driving because it is illegal and unsafe, or <br><br>
* A shopper with shopping bags in both hands trying to make an appointment in their calendar or create a task. <br><br>
* Anyone who needs to create a task/appointment/event directly from a group chat (e.g. Telegram Groups), has lots of copy/paste to do, to move data from the group chat to their calendaring software.<br><br>

In the above situations, they would need to use their hands to open their calendaring app to type in the details, set a notification and email the task to people involved, which would be difficult indeed.  
Moreover, if they are using a computer laptop, they would need to find a place to sit or face the risk prospect of balancing their laptop on one hand while typing with the other. And if they were using a mobile phone, creating tasks and appointments using a tiny screen and keyboard can be a pain.

Rather than manually doing transcription, extraction, summarization, task creation and notification, wouldn’t it be far easier to text or speak to an Intelligent Agent who can do all that within seconds?

And that Intelligent Agent is “Task Slinger”, the protagonist for this 10-man-day project.

TaskSlinger is an intelligent chatbot that takes voice and text input to help users create tasks in their Google Calendar. <br>
This can benefit a wide range of individuals, including: <br>
* Busy professionals:
  * They often have packed schedules and numerous commitments. TaskSlinger can quickly and conveniently add tasks to their calendar without having to manually type them out, saving time and ensuring they don't miss any important appointments. <br><br>
* Individuals with disabilities:
  * Those with visual or motor impairments may find it challenging to use a traditional calendar interface. A voice-enabled chatbot provides an accessible alternative, allowing them to manage their calendar hands-free. <br><br>
* Elderly individuals:
  * Older adults may find technology challenging to navigate. A simple voice-based interface for adding calendar events can be more intuitive and user-friendly for this demographic. <br><br>
* Multitaskers:
  * People who are often on the go or juggling multiple tasks can benefit from the convenience of adding calendar events via voice or text. They can quickly create reminders or schedule appointments without interrupting their current activity. <br><br>
* Students:
 * Students often have busy schedules with classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities. A chatbot can help them stay organized by quickly adding deadlines, exam dates, or social events to their calendar.<br> <br>
An intelligent chatbot like TaskSlinger that takes voice and text input to create tasks in Google Calendar (or others) can provide a more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly experience for individuals with busy schedules, disabilities, or those who simply prefer a more conversational way of interacting with technology.<br><br>
